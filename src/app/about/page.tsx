Hi there, I'm Fachry, though I am often called El. I am 18 years old and work as an investor, trader, and full-stack developer. I created this website to document everything about her ( Suci Nur Insani ) the most beautiful woman I have ever met. She is not only the most beautiful but also the most remarkable and extraordinary woman I have ever known. 
Through this website, I aim to express all my feelings for her and share every detail about her. I hope that my words will convey the depth of my emotions for her.`;
